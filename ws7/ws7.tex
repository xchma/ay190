\section*{Measuring $\pi$ with an MC Experiment}
The MC estimate of $\pi$ with increasing number of points, $N$, is tabulated in Table~\ref{tb1}. The absolute error versus $\sqrt{N}$ is plotted in Figure~\ref{fig1}. The error basically follows $\sim 1/\sqrt{N}$ for not too large $N$. There is a threshold above which the error cannot be reduced by increasing $N$.
\input{tb1}

\section*{The Birthday Paradox}
For number of people $N$, recall that there are 365 days in a year, the probability that at least two of them have same birthday is 
\begin{equation}
 P = 1 - \frac{365!/(365-N)!}{365^N} ,
\end{equation}	
where the bulk after the minus sign is just the probability that all of them have different birthdays.

WIth MC method, for each $N$, I do 20000 experiments and get an estimated probability as tabulated below.
\input{tb2}


\section*{MC Integration}
In this section, the intergration
\begin{equation}
  I = \int_2^3 f(x)~{\rm d}x = \int_2^3 x^2+1~{\rm d}x = \frac{22}{3}
\end{equation}
will be calculated using MC method.

The results are tabulated in the following table and the error as a function of $\sqrt{N}$ is plotted in Figure~\ref{fig2}. As in question 1, the error basically follows $\sim 1/\sqrt{N}$ for not too large $N$. There is a threshold above which the error cannot be reduced by increasing $N$.
