\section*{Linear System}
(1) Using {\tt np.loadtxt} to read $A$ and $\bf b$: \\
{\tt A=np.loadtxt("LSEi\_m.dat")} \\
{\tt b=np.loadtxt("LSEi\_bvec.dat")} \\

The size of these systems are 10, 100, 200, 1000 and 2000 from $i=1$ to $5$. Using {\tt SciPy} routine {\tt numpy.linalg.slogdet} to calculate the logarithmic of the determinant of $A$ to determine whether these systems are solvable. The result is all of them can be solved.

(2) I provide my own Gauss elimination routine {\tt gaussian.py}. Inside it, I add a few sentence in order to jump out the routine and claim an error if the systems is not solvable. The routine has been widly tested using a series of different $3\times3$ systems, including some of extreme cases. The solutions are solved as ``{\tt LSEi\_soln.dat}". The time consumption is listed in Table~\ref{tb} and plotted in Figure~\ref{fig}. In general, it follows an $O(N^3)$ complexity.

(3) I use {\tt scipy.linalg.lu\_solve} routine, which is based on $LU$ decomposition method. The time comsumption is listed in Table~\ref{tb} and plotted in Figure~\ref{fig} for a reference. This routine is much faster than Gaussian elimination. It looks like a complexity of $O(N^n)$ ($n<3$) for smaller $N$, while incease to $O(N^3)$ for large $N$. However, this may result from system flutuations and therefore needs more tests.
